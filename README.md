# OpenSeesPy-Examples
## By: A. H. Namadchi
This is a more pythonic implementation of OpenSeesPy library to model and analyze structural problems. Examples are as follows:

1. [Double-Layer Shallow Dome (Dynamic Analysis - Geometric Nonlinearity)](/Double-Layer%20Shallow%20Dome.ipynb)
2. [Bathe Model Problem (Dynamic Analysis - Linear)](/Bathe%20Model%20Problem.ipynb)
3. [Elastoplastic SDOF system (Dynamic Analysis)](/Elastoplastic%20SDOF%20system.ipynb)
4. [Elastic Response Spectra](/Elastic%20Response%20Spectra.ipynb)
5. [Curved arch (Dynamic Snap-Through)](/Curved%20arch.ipynb)
6. [Nonlinear seismic response of a MRF](/NLSMRF.ipynb)
7. [Gravity, Modal, Pushover and Time-History Analysis of 2-Story Steel MRF](/Two%20Story%20Steel%20MRF%20(FGU).ipynb)
