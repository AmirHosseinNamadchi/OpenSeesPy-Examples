# OpenSeesPy-Examples
## By: A. H. Namadchi
This is a more pythonic implementation of OpenSeesPy library to model and analyze structural problems. Examples are as follows:

1. [Double-Layer Shallow Dome (Dynamic Analysis - Geometric Nonlinearity)](/Double-Layer%20Shallow%20Dome.ipynb)
1. [Bathe Model Problem (Dynamic Analysis - Linear)](/Bathe%20Model%20Problem.ipynb)
